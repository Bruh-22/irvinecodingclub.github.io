# Lesson 1 Introduction

In this course, we will use Python program to solve mathematical problems. We will introduce various algorithms in Computer Science which can be used to deal with math problems. After learning this course, students will be able to practise by themselves to solve problems in Project Euler.


### Project Euler
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.
